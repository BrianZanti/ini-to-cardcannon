story_text: As any kind of user on the system
    When I visit the items index page ("/items")
    I see an area with statistics:
    - the top 5 most popular items by quantity purchased, plus the quantity bought
    - the bottom 5 least popular items, plus the quantity bought
    NEWLINE
    "Popularity" is determined by total quantity of that item ordered
