story_text: ## Merchant Dashboard
    This is the landing page when a merchant logs in. Here, they will see their contact information (but cannot change it), some statistics, and a list of pending orders that require the merchant's attention.
    ### Admins can act on behalf of merchants
    Admin users will see more information on the "/merchants" route that all users see. For example, on this page, an admin user can navigate to each merchant's dashboard under a route like "/admin/merchants/7". This will allow the admin to perform every action that the merchant themselves can perform. Admin users can also "downgrade" a merchant account to become a user account.

    If any users have pending orders containing items I sell
    Then I see a list of these orders.
    Each order listed includes the following information:
    - the ID of the order, which is a link to the order show page ("/dashboard/orders/15")
    - the date the order was made
    - the total quantity of my items in the order

    When I visit my dashboard, I see an area with statistics:
    - top 5 items I have sold by quantity
    - total quantity of items I've sold, and as a percentage against my sold units plus remaining inventory (eg, if I have sold 1,000 things and still have 9,000 things in inventory, the message would say something like "Sold 1,000 items, which is 10% of your total inventory")
    - top 3 states where my items were shipped
    - top 3 city/state where my items were shipped (Springfield, MI should not be grouped with Springfield, CO)
    - name of the user with the most orders from me (pick one if there's a tie)
    - name of the user who bought the most total items from me (pick one if there's a tie)
    - top 3 users who have spent the most money on my items

    When I visit a merchant's dashboard ("/admin/merchants/6")
    I see a link to "downgrade" the merchant's account to become a regular user
    The merchant themselves do NOT see this link
    When I click on that link
    I am redirected to ("/admin/users/6") because the merchant is now a regular user
    And I see a flash message indicating the user has been downgraded
    The next time this user logs in they are no longer a merchant
    Only admins can see the "downgrade" button
    Only admins can reach any route necessary to downgrade the merchant to user status

    eg, if I visit "/admin/merchants/7" but that merchant is a regular user
    then I am redirected to "/admin/users/7" and see their user profile page
