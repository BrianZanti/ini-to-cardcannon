    When I click the "Users" link in the nav (only visible to admins)
    Then my current URI route is "/admin/users"
    Only admin users can reach this path.
    I see all users in the system
    Each user's name is a link to a show page for that user ("/admin/users/5")
    Next to each user's name is the date they registered
    Next to each user's name I see what type of user they are
