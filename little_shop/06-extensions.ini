    When I check out
    I see a flash message with a randomly generated, 10 digit verification code associated with that order
    NEWLINE
    I can use that verification code to search for an order through the nav bar.
    If an order is found, I am redirected to a verified order page ('/verified_order')
    On that verified order page, I can:
      - click a link to delete the order
      - update the shipping address for an order
      - remove items from the order
