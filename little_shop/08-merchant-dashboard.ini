    This is the landing page when a merchant logs in. Here, they will see their contact information (but cannot change it), some statistics, and a list of pending orders that require the merchant's attention.

    ### Admins can act on behalf of merchants
    Admin users will see more information on the "/merchants" route that all users see. For example, on this page, an admin user can navigate to each merchant's dashboard under a route like "/admin/merchants/7". This will allow the admin to perform every action that the merchant themselves can perform. Admin users can also "downgrade" a merchant account to become a user account.

    When I visit my dashboard, I see an area with statistics:
    - top 5 items I have sold by quantity, and the quantity of each that I've sold
    - total quantity of items I've sold, and as a percentage against my sold units plus remaining inventory (eg, if I have sold 1,000 things and still have 9,000 things in inventory, the message would say something like "Sold 1,000 items, which is 10% of your total inventory")
    - top 3 states where my items were shipped, and their quantities
    - top 3 city/state where my items were shipped, and their quantities (Springfield, MI should not be grouped with Springfield, CO)
    - name of the user with the most orders from me (pick one if there's a tie), and number of orders
    - name of the user who bought the most total items from me (pick one if there's a tie), and the total quantity
    - top 3 users who have spent the most money on my items, and the total amount they've spent

    And I see a flash message indicating the user has been downgraded
    The next time this user logs in they are no longer a merchant
