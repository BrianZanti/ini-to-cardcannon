title = Epic: Navigation
labels: in progress, navigation
child_of: epic-application
story_text: ## Navigation
    This series of stories will set up a navigation bar at the top of the screen and present links and information to users of your site.
    NEWLINE
    There is no requirement that the nav bar be "locked" to the top of the screen.
    NEWLINE
    ### Completion of these stories will encompass the following ideas:
    NEWLINE
    - the navigation is built into app/views/layouts/application.html.erb or loaded into that file as a partial
    - you write a single set of tests that simply click on a link and expect that your current path is what you expect to see
    - your nav tests don't need to check any content on the pages, just that current_path is what you expect
    NEWLINE
    You will need to set up some basic routing and empty controller actions and empty action view files.
