This is how I grouped up the old notes about the project into 'themes' of stories around the game, the round, how to generate a wheel, etc.



games:
- have 3 players
- have 4 rounds
- winner has highest accumulated "account" total after 4th round

players:
- start with an "account" of $0
- sees a score indicating that round's accumulated money next to their name
- can quit and start a new game at any time

start of each round:
- a random "puzzle" word is chosen when the round starts
- a randomized "wheel" is chosen
- all letters are hidden from players; UI shows clear indications of letters/spaces
- puzzle category is displayed to all players
- players have a temporary accumulated score of $0

during the round:
- UI updates to show which letters have already been guessed
- players choose one of three options when it's their turn:
  - solve the puzzle
    - if I solve correctly:
      - the round is over and my accumulated money is added to my "account" score
      - all other players lose any accumulated money during that round only
    - if I do not solve correctly, my turn is over

  - spin the wheel
    - if I land on "lose your turn", my turn ends
    - if I land on "bankruptcy", my accumulated money for that round is reset to $0
    - if I land on a dollar amount:
      - I choose a consonant
      - if that consonant was previously guessed, I am prompted to guess again
      - if that consonant is a valid letter in the puzzle:
        - each instance of that letter is revealed in the puzzle
        - my accumulated money for that round is increased by the dollar amount multiplied by the number of letters newly revealed
        - my turn continues
      - if that consonant is not a valid letter in the puzzle, my turn is over

  - buy a vowel
    - I am prompted to choose a vowel
    - if that vowel was previously guessed, I am prompted to guess again
    - my accumulated score is reduced by $100 regardless if I choose a correct vowel


ending a round:
- round is finished when a player solves the puzzle word correctly
- winner has their accumulated money added to their "account" score

bonus round:
- winner does a bonus round alone, with a bonus puzzle word, and a bonus wheel
- a new puzzle word/phrase is chosen that contains a minimum of 6 consonants
- a new wheel is chosen without bankruptcy spaces; player spins the wheel to reveal their money/prize to win in that round
- player is prompted to pick 1 vowel and 3 consonants; correct choices are revealed on the puzzle; no money is added to their accumulated round score.
- is asked to solve the puzzle
  - If I guess correctly:
    - the prize or cash award from the bonus wheel is added to my "account" score
  - If I guess incorrectly, I do not win the additional money/prize for that round
  - My total "account" score is shown on the UI

puzzles:
- game chooses least one bank of puzzle words/phrases
- each word puzzle has a category like "phrase", "person", "things" etc

wheels:
- a wheel must have at least 6 elements; each element is one of the following:
  - positive dollar amount
  - lose a turn
  - bankruptcy
- the wheel for the bonus round will be special prizes or positive dollar amounts
