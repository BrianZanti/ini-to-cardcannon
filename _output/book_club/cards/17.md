As a Visitor,
When I visit the book index page,
I see a link that allows me to add a new book.
When I click that link, I am taken to a new book path.
I can add a new book through a form, including the book's
title, author(s), and number of pages in the book.
When I submit the form, I am taken to that book's show page.

Book titles should be converted to Title Case before saving.
Book titles should be unique within the system.
For authors, a comma-separated list of names should be entered,
and each author will be added to the database.
Authors added to the database should have their names converted
to Title Case.
Author Names should be unique within the system.
