As a Visitor,
When I visit a book's show page,
I see the following book information:
- the book title
- the author(s) who wrote the book
- the number of pages in the book
- the year the book was published
- a large image of the book cover

I also see a list of reviews for that book.
Each review will have a title and user, a numeric rating
from 1 to 5, and text for the review itself, and all content
must be present for each review.
