As a Visitor,
When I visit a book's show page,
I see the book title, the author(s) and the number of pages in the book.
I also see a list of reviews for that book.

Each review will have a title and user, a numeric rating
from 1 to 5, and text for the review itself, and all content
must be present for each review.
