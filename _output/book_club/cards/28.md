As a Visitor,
When I visit an author's show page,
I see a link on the page to delete the author.
This link should return me to the book index page where I
no longer see this author listed.
If this author was the only author for any book, that book is also deleted.
If this author co-authored a book with someone else, that book should also be deleted, but not the other author.

(you may need to delete other content before you can delete an author or book)
