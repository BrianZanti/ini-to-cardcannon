```
As a visitor
When I visit the Merchant Index page
Then I see a link to create a new merchant
When I click this link
Then I am taken to '/merchants/new' where I  see a form for a new merchant
When I fill out the form with a new merchant's:
- name
- address
- city
- state
- zip
And I click the button to submit the form
Then a `POST` request is sent to '/merchants',
a new merchant is created,
and I am redirected to the Merchant Index page where I see the new Merchant listed.
