```
As a visitor
When I visit a Merchant Items Index page
Then I see a link to show only active items
And I also see a link to show only inactive items
When I click the link
Then my path is something like '/merchants/:merchant_id/items?active=true'
And I see only the Items sold by the merchant that are active/inactive.
