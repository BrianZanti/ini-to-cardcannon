```
As a visitor
When I visit a merchant show page
Then I see a link to update the merchant
When I click the link
Then I am taken to '/merchants/:id/edit' where I  see a form to edit the merchant's data including:
- name
- address
- city
- state
- zip
The form fields are prepopulated with the merchant's current info
When I fill out the form with updated information
And I click the button to submit the form
Then a `PATCH` request is sent to '/merchants/:id',
the merchant's info is updated,
and I am redirected to the Merchant's Show page where I see the merchant's updated info
```
