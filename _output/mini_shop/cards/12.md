```
As a visitor
When I visit an Item Show page
Then I see a link to update that Item
When I click the link
I am taken to '/items/:id/edit' where I see a form to edit the item's data including:
- name
- price
- description
- image
- inventory
When I click the button to submit the form
Then a `PATCH` request is sent to '/items/:id',
the item's data is updated,
and I am redirected to the Item Show page where I see the Item's updated information
```
