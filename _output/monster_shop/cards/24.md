As a registered user
When I visit my profile page
I see a link to edit my profile data
When I click on the link to edit my profile data
I see a form like the registration page
The form is prepopulated with all my current information except my password
When I change any or all of that information
And I submit the form
Then I am returned to my profile page
And I see a flash message telling me that my data is updated
And I see my updated information
```
