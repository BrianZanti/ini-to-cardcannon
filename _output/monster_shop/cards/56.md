```
As an admin
When I visit the merchant index page
I see a "disable" button next to any merchants who are not yet disabled
When I click on the "disable" button
I am returned to the admin's merchant index page where I see that the merchant's account is now disabled
And I see a flash message that the merchant's account is now disabled
```
