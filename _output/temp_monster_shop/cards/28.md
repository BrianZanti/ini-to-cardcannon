As a registered user
When I add items to my cart
And I visit my cart
I see a button or link indicating that I can check out
And I click the button or link to check out
An order is created in the system, which has a status of "pending"
That order is associated with my user
I am taken to my orders page ("/profile/orders")
I see a flash message telling me my order was created
I see my new order listed on my profile orders page
My cart is now empty
