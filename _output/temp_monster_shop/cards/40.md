```
As a merchant employee or admin
When I visit an order show page from my dashboard
For each item of mine in the order
If the user's desired quantity is greater than my current inventory quantity for that item
Then I do not see a "fulfill" button or link
Instead I see a notice next to the item indicating I cannot fulfill this item
```

DO THESE STORIES FIRST:
- User Story 32, Merchant sees an order show page
