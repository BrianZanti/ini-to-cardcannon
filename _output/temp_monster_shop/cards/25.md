As a registered user
When I visit my profile page
I see a link to edit my password
When I click on the link to edit my password
I see a form with fields for a new password, and a new password confirmation
When I fill in the same password in both fields
And I submit the form
Then I am returned to my profile page
And I see a flash message telling me that my password is updated
