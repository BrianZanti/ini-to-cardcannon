```
As an admin merchant
When I visit the merchant index page
I see an "enable" button next to any merchants whose accounts are disabled
When I click on the "enable" button
I am returned to the admin's merchant index page where I see that the merchant's account is now enabled
And I see a flash message that the merchant's account is now enabled
```
