```
As an admin user
When I visit a user's profile page ("/admin/users/5")
And I click the link to edit the user's profile data
The same behaviors exist as if I were that user trying to change their own data
Except I am returned to the show page path of
"/admin/users/5" when I am finished
```

DO THESE STORIES FIRST:
- User Story 5, Admin Navigation
- User Story 46, Admin User Profile Page
