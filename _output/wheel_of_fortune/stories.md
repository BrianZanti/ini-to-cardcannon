## Wheel of !Fortune

2 week paired project for FE Mod 2 (week 2-3)

## Background and Description
For this project you will learn object-oriented programming (OOP) principles by building the game Wheel of Fortune. This is an opportunity to work with classes to build a program at a larger scale than you have with previous projects. This is also an opportunity for you to build out a program based on user stories - which is more aligned to what you can expect to see working with product managers in a production environment.

Building software, at its core, is about solving problems. Generally speaking, the first step in finding a solution to the problem is to be sure that you have clearly identified the problem as well what features the solution must incorporate. From here, we can flesh out the requirements that specify what our program should have. For the problem of building Wheel of Fortune, the rules of this game will serve as the requirements for the spec.

## Goals and Objectives

- Write a program from scratch
- Design and implement OOP patterns
- Understand and implement ES6 classes
- Implement array iterator and mutator methods to work with game data
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

## Restrictions

To populate your data for WOF, you will be using [this data](https://repl.it/@thatpamiam/WheelOfFortune). Copy this into a separate js file that you can include as a script tag in your HTML file.

You will be using the following JavaScript libraries:

- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) (REQUIRED)
- [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) (and Chai) (REQUIRED)
- Other libraries may be used only with instructor approval.

## Requirements
#### Initial Setup

For this project, you need to use this [Gametime Starter Kit](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/gametime-starter) repo. Follow the instructions in the README for forking the repo and getting it setup. Once you have it set up (through running `npm install`), follow the instructions to verify it is setup correctly.

There are additional notes in the README about where your game logic code goes and where your test code goes as well. Be sure to read through the README before you start coding because for this starter kit to work correctly, it has some underlying assumptions of where files live.

## Code Organization

You should have at least one use-case for [inheritance](https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-ecmascript-6-class-inheritance/) with your classes.

- a parent classâ€™s properties and methods should be shared by all the child classes
- a child class should inherit those properties and methods from the parent class
- a child class should add additional properties or methods, or override the functionality of a parent method
- each class should have its own file with the filename capitalized (e.g. `Level.js`). The class should be capitalized as well. Only code that is a part of this class should be in this file.

## Testing

You should be testing your the correctness of your code throughout your project. Each JavaScript file in your project should have its own test file. (e.g. Your Wheel.js class file should have a corresponding testing file called `Wheel-test.js`)

Your testing suite should test all of the functionality of the game, including the following:

- Class default properties
- Class methods
- Anything that updates class properties
- For the purposes of this project, you will keep your state logic completely separate from your view logic. In other words, your business logic (classes/methods) should not handle anything that deals with the UI (DOM Manipulation).

To do this, you will utilize a separate domUpdates.js file that handles any DOM manipulation that is triggered by your business logic. This is covered in more depth in the testing lesson, which you can find [here](http://frontend.turing.io/lessons/module-2/test-driven-development.html#dom-manipulation).

## Game Mechanics


```
[ ] done

User Story 1, Basic Game Mechanics

As a developer of the game,
I must allow 3 players to play the game,
and I must allow 4 rounds of play for all players,
plus one bonus round for the winner.
```

```
[ ] done

User Story 2, Game Mechanics, Puzzles

As a developer of the game,
I must generate a list of puzzle words (or phrases).
This list is called a "bank" of puzzles.
Each word/phrase has a category such as "phrase", "person", "things" etc
```

```
[ ] done

User Story 3, Game Mechanics, Wheels

As a developer of the game,
I need to be able to randomly generate a "wheel" for each round.
The wheel will have at least 6 prize sections.
Each section can be one of the following:

- positive dollar amount
- lose a turn
- bankruptcy

My wheel generator must be able to generate a "bonus round" wheel.
The "bonus" wheel only contains positive dollar amounts.
The dollar amounts are 10x larger than a regular wheel.
```

```
[ ] done

User Story 4, Beginning a Game

As a visitor,
When I visit the web page,
Then I see a button to start a new game.
Clicking this button starts a new game
Even if one was already in progress.
The game chooses at least one "bank" of puzzles.
```

```
[ ] done

User Story 5, Setting Up a New Game

As a visitor,
When I begin a new game,
All "game" scores are reset to 0,
And I am prompted to enter the names of three players.
The new game begins when I successfully enter three names.
I see scores of 0 next to each player's name
```

User Story 6, Playing a Round, Step 1

As a player of the game,
When a round begins,
A random puzzle word is chosen
A random wheel is generated
Each player is given a "round" score of $0
This score is not the same as their "game" score.
```

```
[ ] done

User Story 7, Playing a Round, Step 2

As a player of the game,
When a round begins,
The UI hides all letters of the puzzle word/phrase
The UI shows the category of the puzzle
The UI shows clear indications of letters/spaces in the word/phrase
```

```

User Story 8, Playing a Round, Step 3

As a player of the game,
Until the round is finished,
Each player is prompted to choose one of three actions:

- solve the puzzle
- spin the wheel
- buy a vowel

The UI should show an easy way to input this choice.
```

User Story 10, Buying a vowel

As a player of the game,
If I choose to buy a vowel,
The UI allows me to enter a choice.
My choices are A, E, I, O, U only.

If there are remaining vowels to guess
My "round" score is reduced by $100.
If I guess a vowel that was already chosen,
I get to guess again

If there are no remaining vowels to guess,
My "round" score is not reduced by $100
And my turn is over.
