```
As a developer of the game,
I need to be able to randomly generate a "wheel" for each round.
The wheel will have at least 6 prize sections.
Each section can be one of the following:

- positive dollar amount
- lose a turn
- bankruptcy

My wheel generator must be able to generate a "bonus round" wheel.
The "bonus" wheel only contains positive dollar amounts.
The dollar amounts are 10x larger than a regular wheel.
```
