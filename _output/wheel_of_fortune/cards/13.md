```
As a player of the game,
If I choose to buy a vowel,
The UI allows me to enter a choice.
My choices are A, E, I, O, U only.

If there are remaining vowels to guess
My "round" score is reduced by $100.
If I guess a vowel that was already chosen,
I get to guess again

If there are no remaining vowels to guess,
My "round" score is not reduced by $100
And my turn is over.
```
