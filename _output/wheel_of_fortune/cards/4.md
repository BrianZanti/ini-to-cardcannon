```
As a developer of the game,
I must generate a list of puzzle words (or phrases).
This list is called a "bank" of puzzles.
Each word/phrase has a category such as "phrase", "person", "things" etc
```

### Checklist:

- [ ] base tests are written
- [ ] base code is written to pass tests
- [ ] code is reviewed for completeness
- [ ] code is merged
- [ ] all tests still pass
