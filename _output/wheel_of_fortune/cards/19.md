```
As a player of the game,
When I choose a consonant,
If that consonant was previously chosen I am prompted to guess again.
If that consonant is a valid letter in the puzzle:

- each instance of that letter is revealed
- my "round" score increases by the money amount on the wheel multiplied
by the number of letters that were just revealed
NELWINE
My turn continues, and I can solve, buy a vowel, or spin the wheel again
```
