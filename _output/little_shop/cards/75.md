```
As an admin user
When I visit a merchant's profile page
I can click on the merchant's items link
And have access to all functionality the merchant does, including
- adding new items
- editing existing items
- enabling/disabling/deleting items

All content rules still apply (eg, item name cannot be blank, etc)
```

DO THESE STORIES FIRST:
- User Story 16, Merchant Items Index Page
- User Story 20, Merchant adds an item
- User Story 22, Merchant edits an item
