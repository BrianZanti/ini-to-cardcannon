```
As an admin user
When I visit the user index page
And I click on a "enable" button for a disabled user
I am returned to the admin's user index page
And I see a flash message that the user's account is now enabled
And I see that the user's account is now enabled
This user can now log in
This user's city/state and orders should be included in all statistics.
```

DO THESE STORIES FIRST:
- User Story 50, Admin User Index Page
