```
As an admin user
When I visit a user's order show page
If the order is still "pending", I see a button or link to cancel the order
When I click the cancel button for an order
The same behaviors happen as if the user canceled the order themselves
```

DO THESE STORIES FIRST:
- User Story 28, User Profile Show Page
- User Story 33, User views an Order Show Page
