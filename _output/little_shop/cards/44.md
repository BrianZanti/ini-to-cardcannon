```
As an admin user
When I log into my dashboard, "/admin/dashboard"
Then I see all orders in the system.
For each order I see the following information:

- user who placed the order, which links to admin view of user profile
- order id
- date the order was created

Orders are sorted by "status" in this order:

- packaged
- pending
- shipped
- cancelled
```

DO THESE STORIES FIRST:
- User Story 51, Admin User Profile Page
