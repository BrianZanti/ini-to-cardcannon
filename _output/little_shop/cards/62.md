```
As an admin user
When I click a new "Users" link in the nav (only visible to admins)
Then my current URI route is "/admin/users"
Only admin users can reach this path.
I see all users in the system who are not merchants nor admins.
Each user's name is a link to a show page for that user ("/admin/users/5")
Next to each user's name is the date they registered
Next to each user's name is a button that says 'Upgrade to Merchant'
