As a visitor
When I visit the merchants index page, I see an area with statistics:
- top 3 merchants who have sold the most by price and quantity, and their revenue
- top 3 merchants who were fastest at fulfilling items in an order, and their times
- worst 3 merchants who were slowest at fulfilling items in an order, and their times
- top 3 states where any orders were shipped (by number of orders), and count of orders
- top 3 cities where any orders were shipped (by number of orders, also Springfield, MI should not be grouped with Springfield, CO), and the count of orders
- top 3 biggest orders by quantity of items shipped in an order, plus their quantities
```
