```
As a merchant
When I visit my items page "/dashboard/items"
I see a link to add a new item to the system
I see each item I have already added to the system, including:
- the ID of the item
- the name of the item
- a thumbnail image for that item
- the price of that item
- my current inventory count for that item
- a link or button to edit the item

If no user has ever ordered this item, I see a link to delete the item
If the item is enabled, I see a button or link to disable the item
If the item is disabled, I see a button or link to enable the item
```

DO THESE STORIES FIRST:
- User Story 34, Merchant Dashboard Show Page
