```
As a visitor
When I visit the login path
I see a field to enter my email address and password
When I submit valid information
If I am a regular user, I am redirected to my profile page
If I am a merchant user, I am redirected to my merchant dashboard page
If I am an admin user, I am redirected to the home page of the site
And I see a flash message that I am logged in
```
