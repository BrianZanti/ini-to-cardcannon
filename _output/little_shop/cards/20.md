As any kind of user on the system
When I visit the items index page ("/items")
I see an area with statistics:
- the top 5 most popular items by quantity purchased, plus the quantity bought
- the bottom 5 least popular items, plus the quantity bought

"Popularity" is determined by total quantity of that item fulfilled
```

DO THESE STORIES FIRST:
- User Story 14, Items Index Page
