As a visitor
When I have items in my cart
And I visit my cart
I see information telling me I must register or log in to finish the checkout process
The word "register" is a link to the registration page
The words "log in" is a link to the login page
```

DO THESE STORIES FIRST:
- User Story 21, User views their cart show page with items in the cart

- User Story 7, User Registration
- User Story 10, User can Login
