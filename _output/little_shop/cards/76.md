```
As a merchant
When I visit an order show page from my dashboard
For each item of mine in the order
If the user's desired quantity is greater than my current inventory quantity for that item
Then I do not see a "fulfill" button or link
Instead I see a big red notice next to the item indicating I cannot fulfill this item
```

DO THESE STORIES FIRST:
- User Story 48, Merchant fulfills part of an order
- User Story 49, Merchant cannot fulfill an order due to lack of inventory
- User Story 35, All Merchants fulfill items on an order
