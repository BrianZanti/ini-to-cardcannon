    When I visit a Merchant Items Index page
      Then I see a link to show only active items
      And I also see a link to show only inactive items
    When I click the link
      Then my path is something like '/merchants/:merchant_id/items?active=true'
      And I see only the Items sold by the merchant that are active/inactive.

story_text: As a visitor
    When I visit an Item Show page
      Then I see a link to change the Item's active status
        Active items should have the link "deactivate"
        Inactive items should have the link "activate"
    When I click the link
      Then a 'PATCH' request is sent to '/items/:id/activate' or 'items/:id/deactivate' (depending on the link)
      and I am redirected to the Item Show page where I see the active status has been toggled
