story_text: ## User Order Show Page
    The show page template for an order can be shared between users, merchants and admins to DRY up our presentation logic. They will operate through separate controllers, though.
    NEWLINE
    ### User Control
    - Users can cancel an order if an admin has not "shipped" that order
    - When an order is cancelled, any fulfilled items have their inventory returned to their respective merchants
    NEWLINE
    ### Merchant Control
    - Merchants only see items in the order that are sold by that merchant
    - Items from other merchants are hidden
    NEWLINE
    ### Admin Control
    - Admins can cancel an order on behalf of a user
    - Admins can fulfill items on order on behalf of a merchant
